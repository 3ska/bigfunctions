## üîçÔ∏è What is BigFunctions?

> 1. **Open BigQuery functions giving SQL-superpowers callable without install from your BigQuery project üí™**
> 2. **A framework to define, test, deploy, document and monitor BigQuery Routines üî®**

<br>


## üí° Why BigFunctions?

BigQuery is very powerful as you can:
- create native SQL and javascript routines,
- deploy any remote function as a *cloud function* / *cloud run* in your favorite language and with your favorite dependencies/executables.

Yet, building solutions above these powerful features necessitates time and experience and we believe data-teams should NOT waste effort in reimplementing solutions for challenges already solved by other data-teams.

üëâ We believe open-source is the way to go for data-people to share their work, help each other, inspire from each other and avoid reinventing the wheel. That's why we created BigFunctions.

## üëÄ Explore and call Public BigFunctions from you own BigQuery Project

Public and shared BigFunctions give you **SQL-superpowers** such as:

- advanced transforms such as computing sentiment score of a text, or computing the latitude, longitude of an address, run graph algorithms, etc
- advanced data-explorations/vizualisations from your BigQuery console, your notebooks, your IDE.
- communication with all your SAAS to bring a common logic orchestrated from your data-warehouse and optionnaly from dbt.

Follow the following links to explore and call public BigFunctions from you own BigQuery Project:

## ‚ö°Ô∏è BigFunctions Framework Features

‚úÖ **create a unique standard to define BigQuery routines be it sql/js/remote UDF or procedures**
‚úÖ **Provide `bigfun` a CLI (Command Line Interface) to test, deploy, document and monitor these BigQuery routines in your project**

<br>


## üí• `bigfun` CLI

This repo contains a CLI (command-line-interface) called `bigfun` to facilitate BigFunctions development, test, deployment, documentation and monitoring.

### Install `bigfun`

**Install dependencies**

`bigfun` invokes `gcloud` CLI to deploy remote functions. Furthermore, `bigfun` uses BigQuery python client authenticated by default *gcloud app credentials*.

Thus, for `bigfun` to work, please:

- install `gcloud`
- authenticate `gcloud` by running `gcloud init`
- authenticate to create default app credentials by running `gcloud auth application-default login`.

**Install `bigfun`**

Clone the repo and from the repo directory run:

``` sh
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable .
```


### Get needed permissions


### Use `bigfun` üî•

``` sh
$ bigfun --help
Usage: bigfun [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  deploy  Deploy BIGFUNCTION
  doc     Generate, serve and publish documentation
  test    Test BIGFUNCTION
```

## Contribute

You are more than welcome to contribute both for:

- adding/improving BigFunctions
- improving the framework and `bigfun` CLI
