BigFunctions are open BigQuery routines that give you new *SQL powers* in BigQuery ðŸ’ª.


## What is BigFunctions ?

BigFunctions project is two fold:

- offer a framework to easily develop, test and deploy routines called BigFunctions to BigQuery.
- share common useful BigFunctions among the data-community. All BigFunctions defined in 'bigfunctions' folder are deployed publicly and callable from any BigQuery project without installation.

Then,

- If you are interested in calling common BigFunctions, best is to see the [online documentation](https://unytics.github.io/bigfunctions/).
- Otherwise if you wish to develop BigFunctions for yourself or to contribute to this repo OR if you wish to deploy the common BigFunctions in your own GCP project, you may be interested in the following.


## `bigfun` command line

This repo contains a CLI called `bigfun` to facilitate BigFunctions development, test and deployment.
